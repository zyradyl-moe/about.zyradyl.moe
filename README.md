# about.zyradyl.moe
## About
This is the github repository for my personal [about page.][1].

## Domains
- [https://about.zyradyl.moe][1]

## History
Originally hosted on [Github][2], then moved to [Gitlab][3], now back to Github.
Did use [Netlify][4] for a while, back when they offered minifying services. Now
just relying on the [Cloudflare][5] CDN, since Cloudflare is growing to consume
everything anyways.

## Licenses
- Code: [UNLICENSE][6]
- Content: [CC0][7]

## Notes
This is built on [Hugo][9] and makes use of a theme for Hugo called [Stip][10]
which I quite like. The art for my profile picture was done by [xiaomaiYORK][11]
and is fan-art of the character [Jill Stingray][12] from the indie game
[VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartending Action][13] which I am a huge fan of. The
background image I found on [Wallhaven][14] and it unfortunately does not have a
source besides the original uploader on that site.

I used to have a public discord link, but I've taken that offline for various
reasons. As such, I've provided an email link, but with a "clever" (not really)
anti-spam measure built in to hopefully avoid it being scraped.
